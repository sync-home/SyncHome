            <p className='my-5 text-justify'>System administrators can digitally grant, revoke or remove access to visitors. Integrating visitor management systems with existing security infrastructure, such as access control systems, CCTV cameras or biometric facial recognition scanners, enhances overall security measures and ensures only authorised individuals enter restricted areas. In the event of an emergency or evacuation, the system aids in ensuring an accurate headcount and efficient evacuation procedures. A visitor management system can effectively manage and monitor visitor access, minimising potential security breaches and unauthorised entries.</p>
